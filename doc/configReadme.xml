As an administrator I want to aggregate opportunities from Salesforce and NetSuite instances and compare them to see which opportunities can only be found in one of the two and which opportunities are in both instances. 

For practical purposes this Template will generate the result in the format of an e-mail with attached CSV Report.

This Template should serve as a foundation for extracting data from two systems, aggregating data, comparing values of fields for the objects, and generating a report on the differences. 

This implementation retrieves opportunities from both Salesforce and Netsuite instances, compares them (opportunities match if the names are equal), and generates a CSV file which shows opportunities in Salesforce, opportunities in NetSuite, and opportunities present in both systems. The report is then sent to a configured group of e-mail addresses.

<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Once your app is all set up and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sfdc2nets-opportunity-aggregation` to trigger the use case, you just need to hit `http://sfdc2nets-opportunity-aggregation.cloudhub.io/generatereport` and report will be sent to the e-mails configured.

<![CDATA[
After this, to trigger the use case you just need to hit the local HTTP endpoint with the port you configured in your file. If this is, for instance, `9090` then you should hit: `http://localhost:9090/generatereport` and this will create a CSV report and send it to the configured e-mail addresses.

Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. However, we make API call to Salesforce only once during aggregation.

This is the file where you will find the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app. This Template has an HTTP Connector as the way to trigger the use case and an SMTP Transport as the outbound way to send the report.

$H$H# Trigger Flow
**HTTP Connector** - Start Report Generation

+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `generatereport` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.

$H$H# Outbound Flow
**SMTP Outbound Endpoint** - Send Mail

+ Both SMTP configuration and the actual mail to be sent are defined in this endpoint.
+ This flow is going to be invoked from the flow that does all the functional work: *mainFlow*, the same that is invoked from the Inbound Flow upon triggering of the HTTP Endpoint.

Functional aspect of the template is implemented in this XML file, directed by one flow responsible of conducting the aggregation of data, comparing records and finally formating the output, in this case a CSV report.
The *mainFlow* organises the job in three different steps and finally invokes the *outboundFlow* which will deliver the report to the corresponding outbound endpoint.
This flow has Exception Strategy which basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.

$H$H# Gather Data Flow
Mainly consisting of two calls (Queries), one to SalesForce, the other one to NetSuite, and storing each response in the Invocation Variable named *opportunitiesFromSFDC* or *opportunitiesFromNetsuite* accordingly.

$H$H# Aggregation Flow
[Java Transformer](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Java+Transformer+Reference) is responsible for aggregating the results from the SalesForce and NetSuite instances.
Criteria and format applied:

+ Transformer receives a Mule Message with the two Invocation variables *opportunitiesFromSFDC* and *opportunitiesFromNetsuite* to result in List of Maps with keys: **Name**, **IDInSFDC**, **AmountInSFDC**, **IDInNetsuite**, **AmountInNetsuite**.
+ Opportunities will be matched by names. A record in Netsuite matches SFDC record if the names are equal.

$H$H# Format Output Flow

+ [Java Transformer](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Java+Transformer+Reference) responsible for sorting the list of users in the following order:

	1. Opportunities only in SalesForce
	2. Opportunities only in NetSuite
	3. Opportunities in both SalesForce and NetSuite

All records ordered alphabetically by name within each category.
If you want to change this order then the *compare* method should be modified.

+ CSV Report [DataMapper](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Datamapper+User+Guide+and+Reference) transforming the List of Maps in CSV with headers **Name**, **IDInSFDC**, **AmountInSFDC**, **IDInNetsuite**, **AmountInNetsuite**.
+ An [Object to string transformer](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Transformers) is used to set the payload as String.
